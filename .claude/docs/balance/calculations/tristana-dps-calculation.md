# Tristana DPS Calculation Details 💣

This document provides the step-by-step mathematical calculations for Tristana's baseline (unequipped) and well-equipped (3-item) DPS across 1★, 2★, and 3★ star levels.

> **Source of truth**: All base stats are sourced from the **TFT Set 9 Basic data** spreadsheet.
> DPS is calculated from first principles using the formulas below. No external script output is used.

## ⚙️ Core Variables & Mechanics

### 1. Base Stats (from TFT Set 9 Basic data)

**Scaling stats**
| Stat | 1★ | 2★ | 3★ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Base AD** | 45 | 68 | 101 |

**Fixed stats** *(do not scale with star level)*
| Stat | Value |
| :--- | :---: |
| **Attack Speed (AS)** | 0.70 |
| **Max Mana** | 40 |
| **Cast Lockout** | 0.0s |

### 3. Skill Description & Mechanics
*   **Skill**: Gain +70% Attack Speed for 4 seconds. During the duration, attacks explode on impact and deal **60% AD physical damage** to enemies within 1 hex (splash).
*   **Steroid Rotation**: Tristana cannot gain mana during her active steroid. Her cycle consists of a 4-attack mana generation phase followed by a 4-second active steroid phase.
*   **AS Steroid Buff**: She gains AS during her steroid, bringing her unequipped steroid AS to **1.19 AS** (generating 4.76 attacks), and her equipped steroid AS to **2.63 AS** (generating 10.52 attacks).
*   **Splash Density**: Deals splash damage to 1 adjacent target, represented by a **1.00× splash multiplier**.

### Calculations

| Step | Formula | Calculation | 1★ | 2★ | 3★ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ATC | `ceil(Max Mana / 10)` | `ceil(40 / 10)` | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| Cycle Duration | `ATC / AS + Steroid Duration` | `4 / 0.70 + 4.0` | 9.714s | 9.714s | 9.714s |
| Steroid Attacks | `Steroid Duration × (AS × 1.70)` | `4.0 × 1.19` | 4.76 | 4.76 | 4.76 |
| Total Cycle Attacks | `ATC + Steroid Attacks` | `4 + 4.76` | 8.76 | 8.76 | 8.76 |
| Auto Attack DPS | `(Total Cycle Attacks × AD) / Cycle` | `(8.76 × [45, 68, 101]) / 9.714s` | 40.6 | 61.3 | 91.1 |
| Spell Base (1 Target) | `0.60 × AD` | `0.60 × [45, 68, 101]` | 27.0 | 40.8 | 60.6 |
| Spell Damage | `Steroid Attacks × Spell Base` | `4.76 × [27.0, 40.8, 60.6]` | 128.5 | 194.2 | 288.5 |
| Spell DPS | `Spell Damage / Cycle` | `[128.5, 194.2, 288.5] / 9.714s` | 13.2 | 20.0 | 29.7 |

## 🧮 Equipped Calculations (Guinsoo's Rageblade + Last Whisper + Infinity Edge)

### 1. Item Stats & Effects
| Item | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Guinsoo's Rageblade** | Ramps AS (average equipped AS is 1.26 [15s] / 1.63 [30s], steroid AS is 2.26 [15s] / 2.63 [30s]). See [Guinsoo's Rageblade AS Ramp Calculations](file:///c:/Organized%20Files/Working/Unity/Unity%20Project/Magic%20School/.claude/docs/balance/calculations/guinsoo-dps-calculation.md). |
