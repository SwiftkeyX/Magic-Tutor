*   **Cast Lockout**: $1.0$ second base.
*   **Attacks to Cast**: 7 attacks.

#### 🧮 DPS Output Summary
*   **Baseline (Unequipped)**:
    *   15s / 30s Fight: 1★: **77.4** | 2★: **116.8** | 3★: **181.0**

    *   15s / 30s Fight: 1★: **235.5** | 2★: **357.4** | 3★: **546.7**
*   **Detailed DPS Calculations**: [Jinx DPS Calculations](file:///c:/Organized%20Files/Working/Unity/Unity%20Project/Magic%20School/.claude/docs/balance/calculations/jinx-dps-calculation.md)

#### 🔍 Analyze DPS
*   **Splash Cleanup Benchmark**: Jinx represents the baseline for Tier 2 backline splash damage, with output scaling safely above Tier 1 carries due to higher baseline ratios.
*   **Guinsoo's Synergy**: Runaan's Hurricane physical bolts amplify her auto attack contribution, which pairs well with Guinsoo's Attack Speed ramping to scale rocket output.

### 2. Teemo 🍄

#### 🛡️ Mechanics & Combat Nuance
*   **Ability**: Throws an explosive mushroom. detonates on 2.0 targets average, dealing magic damage over 3 seconds and wounding them (-33% healing).
*   **Mana Rules**: Attacks required to cast is 5 (charges 50 max mana).
*   **Cast Lockout**: $0.8$ seconds base.
*   **Attacks to Cast**: 5 attacks.

#### 🧮 DPS Output Summary
*   **Baseline (Unequipped)**:
    *   15s / 30s Fight (2.0 targets avg): 1★: **90.7** | 2★: **136.0** | 3★: **204.0**
*   **Well-Equipped (Blue Buff + Jeweled Gauntlet + Deathcap)**:
    *   15s / 30s Fight: 1★: **223.9** | 2★: **335.9** | 3★: **503.8**
*   **Detailed DPS Calculations**: [Teemo DPS Calculations](file:///c:/Organized%20Files/Working/Unity/Unity%20Project/Magic%20School/.claude/docs/balance/calculations/teemo-dps-calculation.md)

#### 🔍 Analyze DPS
*   **DoT Counterplay**: While Teemo displays very high theoretical DPS numbers, his damage is damage-over-time (DoT) which allows healing counterplay, preventing burst-focused dominance.
*   **Blue Buff Cast Spikes**: Equipped Blue Buff reduces his max mana pool, accelerating his mushroom cycling and increasing AoE board-burn coverage.

### 3. Taliyah 🪨

#### 🛡️ Mechanics & Combat Nuance
*   **Ability**: Active seismic shove knocks up current target. Passive launches boulders dealing magic damage whenever any enemy is knocked up by any source.
*   **Mana Rules**: Attacks required to cast is 6 (charges 60 max mana).
*   **Cast Lockout**: $0.8$ seconds base.
*   **Attacks to Cast**: 6 attacks.

#### 🧮 DPS Output Summary
*   **Baseline (Unequipped)**:
    *   15s / 30s Fight (2 boulders): 1★: **95.7** | 2★: **143.6** | 3★: **215.3**
*   **Well-Equipped (Jeweled Gauntlet + Archangel's + Gunblade)**:
    *   15s / 30s Fight: 1★: **161.9** | 2★: **242.9** | 3★: **364.3**
*   **Detailed DPS Calculations**: [Taliyah DPS Calculations](file:///c:/Organized%20Files/Working/Unity/Unity%20Project/Magic%20School/.claude/docs/balance/calculations/taliyah-dps-calculation.md)

#### 🔍 Analyze DPS
*   **Synergy Dependency**: Taliyah's standalone baseline output is low, but she scales exponentially when paired with knockup synergies (e.g. Sett, Poppy), presenting a highly draft-dependent design.
*   **Archangel's Ramping**: Archangel's Staff adds AP over time, significantly scaling passive boulder damage in late-combat sequences.

### 4. Zed 🥷

#### 🛡️ Mechanics & Combat Nuance
*   **Ability**: Shadow clones double-slash adjacent targets, dealing physical damage scaled by AD ratio.
*   **Mana Rules**: Attacks required to cast is 7 (charges 70 max mana).
*   **Cast Lockout**: $0.8$ seconds base.
*   **Attacks to Cast**: 7 attacks.

#### 🧮 DPS Output Summary
*   **Baseline (Unequipped)**:
    *   15s / 30s Fight (2 targets): 1★: **69.1** | 2★: **103.7** | 3★: **155.2**
*   **Well-Equipped (Infinity Edge + Titan's + Bloodthirster)**:
    *   15s / 30s Fight: 1★: **178.7** | 2★: **268.2** | 3★: **402.2**
*   **Detailed DPS Calculations**: [Zed DPS Calculations](file:///c:/Organized%20Files/Working/Unity/Unity%20Project/Magic%20School/.claude/docs/balance/calculations/zed-dps-calculation.md)

#### 🔍 Analyze DPS
*   **Backline Threat Trade-off**: Zed is balanced strictly below Jinx in multi-target conditions due to his access to backline infiltration, trading raw AoE output for direct carry access.
*   **Titan's and Crit Multipliers**: Infinity Edge ensures his physical slash outputs crit consistently, which scales strongly with the stacked AD and AP from Titan's Resolve.

## 📖 Glossary & Formula Index

*   **AD (Attack Damage)**: The physical damage dealt by a basic auto-attack. AD scales by 1.5x per star level (2★ = 1.5x, 3★ = 2.25x).
*   **AS (Attack Speed)**: The rate of basic attacks per second. Attack Speed remains flat across star levels.
*   **AP (Ability Power)**: The scaling multiplier applied to base spell damage (base is 100 AP / 1.0x).
*   **Attacks to Cast**: The number of basic attacks required to generate the mana pool needed for a cast (each attack generates 10 mana by default, except with Shojin/Blue Buff).
*   **Cast Lockout (s)**: The duration spent executing the spell cast animation, during which basic attacks are paused. Lockout time is fixed and does not scale with AS:
    
    `Cycle Duration = (Attacks to Cast) / (AS) + Cast Lockout + [Steroid Uptime, if mana locked]`

*   **Auto Attack DPS**: The average damage per second contributed strictly by basic auto-attacks over a cycle:
    
    `Auto Attack DPS = (Total Attacks * AD) / (Cycle Duration) * Crit * Amp`

*   **Spell Base**: The unmitigated baseline damage of the spell before accounting for multi-target averages, piercing, or physical scaling ratios.
*   **Spell Damage**: The final output damage of the spell per cycle, applying target averages and modifiers:
    
    `Spell Damage = Spell Base * AP_mult * Target_density * [Splash/Pierce Multipliers] * Crit * Amp`

*   **Spell DPS**: The average damage per second contributed strictly by spell casts over a cycle:
    
    `Spell DPS = Spell Damage / Cycle Duration`

*   **Total DPS**: The unified DPS of the champion combining basic attacks and spell outputs:
    
    `Total DPS = Auto Attack DPS + Spell DPS`

*   **Crit (Critical Strike Multiplier)**: The scaling factor applied to damage to account for crit rate and damage:
    
    `Crit = 1 + Crit Chance * (Crit Damage - 1)`

*   **Amp (Amplification Multiplier)**: The flat damage amplification factor contributed by item passives (e.g. Giant Slayer):
    
    `Amp = Amp_1 * Amp_2 * ...`
